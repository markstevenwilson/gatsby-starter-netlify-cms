I joined Insure.com in January of 2008 where I had was originally bought on as a help desk administrator. One of my tasks was to take Microsoft Word documents sent over from our Editorial team and to update our Website with the contents of the document.
Updating the website was a very time consuming and labor heavy process. The Word documents would contain several versions with multiple edits that would then be copied into JSP files on our webserver. Due to the way the site was architected any file change required a full code deployment and webserver restart. The entire process was a days’ worth of work. If a last minute came in the entire process would have to start from the beginning.

When the IT team was looking into a stand-alone solution to manage editorial content on Insure.com I had suggested Wordpress as I was using it for a couple of personal projects at the time. It had document revision control, user roles and easily customizable. I was tasked with leading the migration of the old JAVA site to Wordpress.

I worked with the Editorial team to customize the content editing experience and trained them on how to manage their content. I Created custom Google Analytics reports for the marketing team and created custom document fields to manage SEO page data. The site had a number of 3rd party marketing tools that were integrated into the site and managed through custom plugins.

The Editorial team was able to bring 30 years’ worth of Insurance content online and The marketing team had a new lead channel with a lower acquisition cost. The site was included in the sale of Insure.com 


This week we’ll **take** a look at all the steps required to make astonishing coffee with a Chemex at home. The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts.

In 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is _"one of the best-designed products of modern times"_, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

## The little secrets of Chemex brewing

The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.
